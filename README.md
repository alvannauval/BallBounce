# BallBounce

This GitHub repository is dedicated to a 3D Simulink simulation for a bouncing ball. The simulation utilizes the Simulink environment, a powerful tool for modeling and simulating dynamic systems. The primary focus of this project is to create a simulation of the Bouncing Ball for a Workshop that held by System and Cybernetics Laboratorium in Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Indonesia.

Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute to the repository.
